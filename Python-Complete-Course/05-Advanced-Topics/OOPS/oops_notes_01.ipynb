    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation** – Hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing necessary details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction** – Simplifying complex systems by exposing only relevant parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance** – Allowing new classes to reuse attributes and methods from an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism** – Allowing different objects to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cohesion** – Keeping related functionalities together within a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Coupling** – Reducing dependencies between different classes to improve modularity."
