    "## **Object-Oriented Programming: Inheritance - Sharing Attributes and Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "This explanation introduces the fundamental concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP). Inheritance allows a new class (child class or subclass) to inherit properties (attributes and methods) from an existing class (parent class or superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The Concept of Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Inheritance is a mechanism that enables code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "+ A child class inherits the characteristics of its parent class, meaning it automatically gains access to the parent's attributes and methods.\n",
    "+ This promotes the \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY) principle by allowing you to define common functionalities in a parent class and reuse them in multiple related child classes.\n",
    "+ Child classes can also extend or modify the inherited behavior, adding their own unique attributes and methods or overriding existing ones."

    "+ Code Reusability: Common attributes and methods defined in the parent class don't need to be redefined in each child class.\n",
    "+ Maintainability: Changes made to the parent class are automatically reflected in its child classes (unless overridden).\n",
    "+ Extensibility: Child classes can add new attributes and methods specific to their type.\n",
